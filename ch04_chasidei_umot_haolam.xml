	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> have animal souls that emanate from
			<emphasis>klipat nogah</emphasis>; the same place where <emphasis>bnei
			Yisrael</emphasis> animal souls originate.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> are not attached to <emphasis>bnei
			Yisrael</emphasis> like <emphasis>gerim</emphasis>. They are still attached to their
		host nation and are held hostage in a way(see Rebbe's Sichot on this matter). They would of
		been with <emphasis>klal Yisrael</emphasis> during <emphasis>maten Torah</emphasis> but
		their host nations held them hostage. Spiritually, they are attached to <emphasis>klal
			Yisrael</emphasis>, but not physically and do not gain those blessings. Those who are
		physically attached by living among <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> are referred to as
			<emphasis>ger toshav</emphasis>. Their host nations receive blessings from them.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> may give a burnt offering.</para>

		<para><emphasis>Chassidei umot haOlam</emphasis> are the same as keepers of the seven laws of
				<emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis>, except they keep the seven laws because
				<emphasis>haShem</emphasis> gave them via Moshe and Torah. There is a disagreement
			if it's because the seven are in Torah or if it's because Moshe received and gave them
			again.</para>
