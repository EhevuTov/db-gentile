	<subtitle>חסדי עמות העלם - Chasidei Umot haOlam</subtitle>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei umot haOlam</emphasis> have animal souls that emanate from
			<emphasis>klipat nogah</emphasis>; the same place where <emphasis>bnei
			Yisrael</emphasis> animal souls originate.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei umot haOlam</emphasis> are not attached to <emphasis>bnei
			Yisrael</emphasis> like <emphasis>gerim</emphasis>. They are still physically still
		among their host nation and are spritually held hostage(see Rebbe's Sichot on this matter).
		Spiritually, they are attached to <emphasis>klal Yisrael</emphasis>, but not physically and
		do not gain those blessings.</para>

		<title>Halacha</title>
		<para><emphasis>Chassidei umot haOlm</emphasis> are the same as keepers of the seven laws of
				<emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis>, except they keep the seven laws because
				<emphasis>haShem</emphasis> gave them via Moshe and Torah. There is a disagreement
			if it's because the seven are in Torah or if it's because Moshe received and gave
			them.</para>
