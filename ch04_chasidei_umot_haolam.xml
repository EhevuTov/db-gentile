	<subtitle>חסדי עמות העלם - Chasidei Umot haOlam</subtitle>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> are not attached to <emphasis>bnei
			Yisrael</emphasis> like <emphasis>gerim</emphasis>. They are still attached to their
		host nation and are held hostage in a way(see Rebbe's Sichot on this matter). They would of
		been with <emphasis>klal Yisrael</emphasis> during <emphasis>maten Torah</emphasis> but
		their host nations held them hostage. Spiritually, they are attached to <emphasis>klal
			Yisrael</emphasis>, but not physically and do not gain those blessings. Those who are
		physically attached by living among <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> are referred to as
			<emphasis>ger toshav</emphasis>. Their host nations receive blessings from them.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> may give a burnt offering.</para>
	<para><emphasis>Chassidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> have animal souls that emanate from
			<emphasis>klipat nogah</emphasis>. <emphasis>Klipot nogah</emphasis> contains a mixture
		of good and evil and is the same place where <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> animal souls
		and clean animal souls originate.</para>

		<para>It says that Avraham has kept all of <emphasis>haShem's</emphasis>
			<emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis> and <emphasis>Torot</emphasis>. An opinion says that
				<emphasis>Avraham</emphasis> kept the <emphasis>sheva mitzvot bnei Noach</emphasis>
			and <emphasis>brit milah</emphasis>. Another opinion says that he kept both the
				<emphasis>Torah sheba'alpeh</emphasis> and <emphasis>Torah shebikhtav</emphasis>. It
			appears to me that both opinions are correct and do not contradict. How could
				<emphasis>Avraham</emphasis> have kept <emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis> that were yet to
			be commanded? He did them through the <emphasis>Torah of Shem v'Ever</emphasis>.
				<emphasis>Avraham</emphasis> was the first <emphasis>ger tzedek</emphasis>. Yoma

		<title>Halacha</title>
		<para><emphasis>Chassidei umot haOlam</emphasis> are the same as keepers of the seven laws of
				<emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis>, except they keep the seven laws because
				<emphasis>haShem</emphasis> gave them via Moshe and Torah. There is a disagreement
			if it's because the seven are in Torah or if it's because Moshe received and gave them
			again.</para>
