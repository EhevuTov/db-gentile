	<para>You've probably heard that the proper word for <emphasis>non-Jew</emphasis> is
			<emphasis>gentile</emphasis>. This is historically and halachically<footnote>
			<para><emphasis>Halachah</emphasis> is the rulings of Torah that are followed</para>
		</footnote> wrong. The word <emphasis>gentile</emphasis> was not created by Judaism. It is a
		word used by Romans from the Latin language generally used to describe non-Roman
		citizens.</para>

		<para><emphasis>Gentile</emphasis> was used to denote anyone not of Roman citizenship and
			from a clan or tribe: a barbarian. At this time, the literal word
				<emphasis>gentile</emphasis> was never used in the Jewish vernacular. The closest
			term Jews had to denote non-Jews of other tribes, clans, or peoples, was the word
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis>, which we'll talk about in the next chapter.</para>
		<para>Not only can <emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis> do more, although not mandatory, <emphasis>bnei
				Noach</emphasis> are also halachically separate than the <emphasis>goy
				stam</emphasis>(plain goy)(Hilchot Melachim 10:10) who is an idolator(A"KUM)(Hilchot
			Ma'achalot Assurot 11:8). They are different <emphasis>dea’ot</emphasis> - containers of logic.<footnote>
				<para>If a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> who observes the <emphasis>sheva mitzvot
						bnei Noach</emphasis> gives charity, we should accept it from him. It
					appears to me that it should be given to the Jewish poor for the ben Noach may
					derive his sustenance from the Jews and they are commanded to support him if
					necessary. In contrast, if a goy gives charity, we should accept it from him and
					give it to the goy poor." - Rambam, Hilchot Melachim 10:10 (from the Yemenite
					unedited)</para>
