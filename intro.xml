    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This book is out to rectify injustices done from impure speech; particularly in the usage
        of the categories of non-Jews within Jewish Law: the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. This book
        will help to end antisemitism by re-humanizing the non-Jew within the
            <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> through the lens of proper terms used for non-Jews and their
        respective laws. There is a vicious cycle of de-humanization between the Jew and non-Jew
        that can be stopped by using pure speech and logical application of that speech to proper
        definitions within <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> has never been the
        problem. Rather, misunderstandings of different types of non-Jews is the main problem in
        this regard. Specifically, this book is about subsets of non-Jews, their critical
        definitions, and <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> law pertaining to their respective non-Jew
        subsets. These subsets are either entirely mutually exclusive, or have only some mutual
        exclusivity in respect to their properties. For instance, the set of all humans have
        chromosomes, but not all humans keep kosher; so the subsets are defined in respect to the
        properties wrote about in this book. This book is about specific subsets of non-Jews and
        their respective properties. These subsets or categories, are called
            <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> in Hebrew.</para>
    <para>Once the reader sees the different <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> of non-Jews within
            <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> using their proper Hebrew nouns as described in this book,
        the reader will be able to see the improper usage of terms about the different non-Jews and
        how such terms lead to misunderstanding and misapplication of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>
        law, foundational misquotes for antisemitism, etc. An example, is a translation of a major
        redactor of Jewish Law known as the R"AMBAM which says in his <emphasis>Mishneh
            Torah</emphasis> that a non-Jew who studies the Torah is obligated to die. Such a
        translation that depicts all non-Jews not only sounds horrible, it's actually wrong. In
        reality, the verse in the original Hebrew is only in relation to <emphasis role="bold"
            >wicked</emphasis> non-Jews, who for the most part in our western culture today, don't
        exist. Unfortunately, this is the common translation of such verses of
            <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> law pertaining to non-Jews. Such translations and traditions
        about the non-Jew promulgate within the unlearned Jewish community and eventually end up in
        the non-Jewish community.</para>
    <para><emphasis>Gedarim</emphasis> have certain properties associated with them. For instance,
        let's look at the word <emphasis>goy</emphasis>. The <emphasis>geder</emphasis> for
            <emphasis>goy</emphasis> has a legal status such that a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> that
        gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>/charity to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>/child of
        Israel(colloquially: a Jew): <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="bold">cannot</emphasis> benefit from that <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis> and
        the <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis> must be given instead to the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
        poor. However, when a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>/child of Noah, which is under a
        different <emphasis>geder</emphasis> gives charity to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>, the
        poor of <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="bold">can</emphasis> use that <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>. Even more so,
            <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> has a <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis>/commandment to sustain
        the life of a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> in trouble, while <emphasis>bnei
            Yisrael</emphasis> have no such <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> for the
            <emphasis>goy</emphasis>. Even contrary, <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> are obligated
        to not save a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> from death. So then, one must ask: What is a
            <emphasis>goy</emphasis>? What is a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>? Why are they treated
        differently?</para>
    <para>Many will tell you that the <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and the <emphasis>ben
            Noach</emphasis> are the same thing: that they're all <emphasis>gentiles</emphasis> or
        non-Jews. However, as one can see, they're not. There is some mutual exclusivity, as we just
        read, between the <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and the <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> who gives
            <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>. These different categories of non-Jews will be explained
        in this book. This book will properly show some correct definitions and differences of these
            <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> of non-Jews, which will expose many horrible translations
        or misunderstandings about quotes of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> taken out of context to
        wrongfully justify de-humanization or hatred of the Jew and non-Jew. This book will help
        break that vicious cycle by bringing back purity of language and help bring peace.<footnote>
            <para>"For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language, That they all may call on
                haShem, To serve Him with one accord." - Zephaniah 3:9</para>
        </footnote> The R"AMBAM in his Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 10:10, shows a good example
        of two different <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis>.<footnote>
            <para>"A <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> that wants to do a
                <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis>/commandment from the other <emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis>
                of the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>(beyond the seven of <emphasis>bnei
                    Noach</emphasis>) in order to receive reward, [<emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis>]
                does not keep him from doing it properly. And if he brings a burnt offering, we
                receive it. If he gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>, we receive it from him and it
                appears to me that it is given to the poor of <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis>. He
                receives his sustenance from <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> and it is a
                    <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> to sustain his life. However, the
                    <emphasis>goy</emphasis> that gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>, we receive it
                and give it to the poor <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>" - R"AMBAM, Hilchot Melachim
                10:10</para>
        </footnote> Even though both <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> are
        in the set of non-Jews, they are their own respective subset with their own respective
        properties and laws. These sets or categories are called <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> and it
        is these sets and their respective properties is mostly what this book is about.</para>
