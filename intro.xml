    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This book about specific sub-sets of non-Jews. Depending on what the set is referring to,
        these subsets are either subsets entirely, or have only some mutual exclusivity in respect
        to their properties. For instance, all humans have chromosomes, but not all humans keep
        kosher; so the subsets are defined in respect to the properties talked about. This book is
        about specific properties and their respective sets.</para>
