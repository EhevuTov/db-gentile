    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This book is about specific sub-sets of non-Jews. These subsets are either entirely
        mutually exclusive, or have only some mutual exclusivity in respect to their properties. For
        instance, all humans have chromosomes, but not all humans keep kosher; so the subsets are
        defined in respect to the properties talked about. This book is about specific subsets and
        their respective properties. These subsets or categories, are called
            <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> in Hebrew.</para>
    <para><emphasis>Gedarim</emphasis> have certain properties associated with them. For instance,
        let's take a look at the word <emphasis>goy</emphasis>. The <emphasis>geder</emphasis> for
            <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is such that a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> that gives
            <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>/charity to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>:
            <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> cannot benefit from that <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>
        and the <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis> must be given instead to the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
        poor. However, when a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>/child of Noah, which is under a
        different <emphasis>geder</emphasis> gives charity to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>, the
        poor of <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> can use that <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>. Even
        more so, <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> has a <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> to sustain the life
        of a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>, while <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> have no
            <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> for the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>. Even contrary,
            <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> are obligated to not save a <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
        from death. What is a <emphasis>goy</emphasis>? What is a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>?
        Why are they treated differently? Many will tell you that the <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and
        the <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> are the same thing: that they're all
            <emphasis>gentiles</emphasis> or non-Jews. However, they're not. These different
        categories of non-Jews will be explained in this book. This book will properly show some
        correct definitions and differences of these <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> of non-Jews, which
        will expose many horrible translations or misunderstandings about quotes of
            <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> taken out of context to wrongfully justify de-huminization or
        hatred of the Jew and non-Jew. The R"AMBAM in his Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 10:10,
        shows a good example of two different <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis>.<footnote>
            <para>"A <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> that wants to do a
                <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis>/commandment from the other <emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis>
                of the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>(beyond the seven of <emphasis>bnei
                    Noach</emphasis>) in order to receive reward, [<emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis>]
                does not keep him from doing it properly. And if he brings a burnt offering, we
                receive it. If he gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>, we receive it from him and it
                appears to me that it is given to the poor of <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis>. He
                receives his sustenance from <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> and it is a
                    <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> to sustane his life. However, the
                    <emphasis>goy</emphasis> that gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>, we receive it
                and give it to the poor <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>" - R"AMBAM, Hilchot Melachim
                10:10</para>
        </footnote> Even though both <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> are
        in the set of non-Jews, they are their own respective subset with their own respective
        properties and laws. These sets or categories are called <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> and it
        is these sets and their respective properties is mostly what this book is about.</para>
