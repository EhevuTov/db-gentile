    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This book is about specific sub-sets of non-Jews. Depending on what the set is referring
        to, these subsets are either entirely mutually exclusive, or have only some mutual
        exclusivity in respect to their properties. For instance, all humans have chromosomes, but
        not all humans keep kosher; so the subsets are defined in respect to the properties talked
        about. This book is about specific properties and their respective sets. These subsets or
        categories, are called <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> in Hebrew.</para>
    <para><emphasis>Gedarim</emphasis> have certain properties associated with them. For instance,
        the <emphasis>geder</emphasis> for <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is such that a
            <emphasis>goy</emphasis> that gives <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>(charity) to
            <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>, <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> cannot benefit from
        it and the <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis> must be given to the <emphasis>goy</emphasis> poor.
        However, when a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> which is under a different
            <emphasis>geder</emphasis> gives charity to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>, the poor
        of <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> can use that <emphasis>tzedakah</emphasis>.<footnote>
            <para>R"AMBAM, Hilchot Melachim 10:10</para>
        </footnote> This shows a good example of two different <emphasis>gedarim</emphasis> even
        though both <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> are in the set of
        non-Jews. <emphasis>Gedarim</emphasis> and there given properties is mostly what this book
        is about.</para>
