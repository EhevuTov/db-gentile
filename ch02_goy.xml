	<title>Goy</title>
	<para>You've probably heard the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> used in reference to
		non-Jews.</para>
	<para>Colloquially, the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is used to refer to a non-Jew. However,
		students of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> generally do not care too much for modern
		colloquiallisms in their studies. Therefore, we will not be referring to this type of
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis>. Instead, we will be referrring to the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
		found in <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. This is the <emphasis>goy stam</emphasis> - the plain
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis>.</para>
	<para>In <emphasis>Torah shebikhtav</emphasis>, the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> seems to have
		a neutral connotation, where any negativity toward <emphasis>goy</emphasis> would be
		implied. This may not actually be true, but it seems that way. However, it seems during the
		time of the Prophets and Writings, <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> started getting a bad wrap for
		being primarily idol worshippers. This connotation carried over into the <emphasis>Torah
			sheba'alpeh</emphasis>, where <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> as idolaters were solidified.
		It is only with other qualifiers that <emphasis>goy</emphasis> changes its idolater
		status.</para>

		<title><emphasis>Goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>Am</emphasis>: The Difference</title>
		<para>The words <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>am</emphasis> are usually both translated
			as "people" or "nation" and are seemingly interchangeable. However, that doesn't seem to
			be the case every time. <emphasis>Goy</emphasis> seems to denote something akin to
			culture and way of life and a common king. <emphasis>Am</emphasis> seems to denote
			physical groups of people that live and interact with one another, but do not have a
			common king. <emphasis>Bnei Yisrael</emphasis> is referred to as a holy
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis>; often translated as <emphasis>holy nation</emphasis>. -

		<title>Halacha</title>
		<para>Halachah for the <emphasis>goy</emphasis></para>
		<para>There is no non-Jew so lowely as the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>. It can then be
			logically implied that this not a respected or honored status for non-Jews and something
			you would want to not be of.</para>
		<para>Rambam says that whenever he mentions the goy without any other qualifiers, he's referring
			to the idolater(Hilchot Maachalot Assurot 11:8). Whenever the term
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis> is mentioned in <emphasis>halachah</emphasis> without any
			other qualifiers, it's referring to the idol worshipper. Other peoples are definitely
			goyim as well, but have qualifiers. <footnote id="Gittin_45b">

			<footnote id="Maachalot_assurot_11_8">
				<para>"Wherever we write 'goy' without any further qualifiers, we are referring to
					the worshipper of idols" - Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Ma'achalot Assurot 11:8</para>
				<para>Some say that this citation is referring to only the context of wine. It's
					true that this is referring to the context of wine, but not regarding the
						<emphasis>goy</emphasis>. It's referring to the usage of the word
					"forbidden". Rambam often writes in incomplete sentences, much like an outline.
					Rambam is trying to clarify here. Also, this definition of
						<emphasis>goy</emphasis> only within the context of wine would contradict
					the <emphasis>Chazal</emphasis> definition of <emphasis>goy</emphasis>.</para>
			</footnote> Bnei Yisrael is a good example; they are referred to as <emphasis>goy
				kadosh</emphasis>. Kadosh is the qualifer and thus this is not referring to the
			idol-worshipper. This is a common confusion point where many people will say that "goy"
			is just a general term. Rambam is explicitly taking the generality out of the equation
			to let the reader know he is explicitly refering to an idolater. Talmud Bavli, Gittin
			45b, Rabbi Eliezer says an unspecified <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is treated like an
			idol-worshipper.</para>
		<para>The acceptance of a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> by the CHIDA's(Azulai) grandson is noted in his
			journal, where he interrogates a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and tell him to recite Shema
			every morning. It turns out, he is not a <emphasis>goy</emphasis> but at least a
				<emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis>. It appears to me he is the <emphasis>ben
				Noach</emphasis> of <emphasis>Hilchot Melachim 10:10</emphasis>.</para>
		<para>King David accepted the nochri and made him one of his lieutenants.</para>
		<para>There are two main types of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> study: <emphasis>lamud</emphasis> and
				<emphasis>osek</emphasis>. <emphasis>Lamud</emphasis> is cursory study you do to
			just memorize and know the thing that you're learning. <emphasis>Osek</emphasis> is when
			you completely lose yourself in the study and digest what you're learning on a very deep
			level. In <emphasis>osek</emphasis> type of study, you are completely involved. You are
			constantly thinking about a thing, concept, idea, verse, etc. A <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
			cannot <emphasis>osek</emphasis> himself in complete <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> study. A
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis> can only <emphasis>osek</emphasis> in the <emphasis>sheva
				mitzvot bnei Noach</emphasis>. He can, however, <emphasis>lamud</emphasis> in any
			aspects of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. A <emphasis>goy</emphasis> can even
				<emphasis>osek</emphasis>
			<emphasis>Chassidut</emphasis>.<caution>
				<para>Plain <emphasis>goy</emphasis> without any further description refers to the
					idol-worshipper by default. This causes huge problems in texts about the non-Jew
					in <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. A lot of those texts cite
						<emphasis>halachah</emphasis>  concerning <emphasis>goy</emphasis>, which
					causes huge confusion for a reader who might instead be a <emphasis>ben
						Noach</emphasis> or <emphasis>bat Noach</emphasis>.</para>
			</caution></para>
		<para>It is forbidden for a <emphasis>Jew</emphasis> to teach his <emphasis>eved</emphasis>
			<emphasis>Torah</emphasis>(Hilchot Avadim 8:18). However, Rabban Gamliel described his
			servant Tavi as a Torah scholar(Sukkah 20b). This seems like a contradiction. In my
			opinion, this seems to suggest the initiative and <emphasis>kavanah</emphasis> must come
			from the non-Jew.</para>
		<para>A <emphasis>goy</emphasis> cannot keep shabbat. He cannot even rest or take time to

					<para>And the Gemara explained:</para>
					<para>"An ox of a Jew which gores an ox of a Canaanite is exempt." They say:
						whichever way you turn -- if "his neighbor" is meant specifically, an ox of
						a Canaanite which gores an ox of a Jew should also be exempt; if "his
						neighbor" is not meant specifically, an ox of a Jew which gores an ox of a
						Canaanite should also be liable. Rabbi Abahu said: it is written, "He stood
						and measured the earth; He beheld and drove asunder the nations" -- [God]
						saw that the Sons of Noah [Gentiles] were not fulfilling the Seven
						Commandments they accepted upon themselves, and permitted their property to
						the Jews. Rabbi Jochanan said, it is learnt from here: "He appeared from
						Mount Paran" -- from Mount Paran [the Giving of the Torah] their property
						was permitted to the Jews.</para>
					<para>(Bava Kama 38a)</para>
					<para>To which the Meiri added:</para>
					<blockquote>
						<para>According to what is said in the Gemara, this law applies only to the
							nations which are not restricted by ways of religions and customs, as
							the Gemara said of them, "[God] saw that the Sons of Noah [non-Jews]
							were not fulfilling the Seven Commandments they accepted upon
							themselves, so He permitted their property to the Jews," as long as they
							are obliged by these commandments -- therefore, those [non-Jews] who
							fulfill the Seven Commandments should be treated by us as we are treated
							by them, and we should not favor ourselves in judgment; now it is
							unnecessary to specify that this is also the case concerning the nations
							restricted by ways of religions and customs.</para>

			<title>Goy and A"KUM Equivalence</title>
			<para>The noun <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and the acronym <emphasis>a"kum</emphasis> are
				equivalent in <emphasis>halachah</emphasis>. This is proven multiple places. One way
				of proof, is when halacha says <emphasis>a"kum</emphasis> and then quotes
					<emphasis>Torah</emphasis> where it says <emphasis>goy</emphasis>(Nedarim
				9:22).</para>

			accept it. However, a <emphasis>ben Noach</emphasis> who keeps the <emphasis>sheva
