		<para><emphasis>Gentile</emphasis> was used to denote anyone not of Roman citizenship and
			from a clan or tribe: a barbarian. At this time, the literal word
				<emphasis>gentile</emphasis> was never used in the Jewish vernacular. The closest
			term Jews had to denote non-Jews of other tribes, clans, or peoples, was the word
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis>, which we'll talk about in another chapter.</para>
		<note>
			<para>Not only can bnei Noach do more, although not mandatory, bnei Noach are also
				halachically separate than the goy stam(plain goy) who is an idolator(A"KUM). They
				are different dea’ot.</para>
