	<para>You've probably heard the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> used in reference to
		non-Jews.</para>
	<para>Colloquially, the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is used to refer to a non-Jew. However,
		students of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> generally do not care too much for modern
		colloquialisms in their studies. Colloquialisms could be right or could be wrong. We won't
		know until we go to the source. Therefore, we will not be referring to this type of
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis>. Instead, we will be referring to the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
		found in <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. This is the <emphasis>goy stam</emphasis> - the plain
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis>.</para>
	<para>In the <emphasis>Chumash</emphasis>/first five Books of Moses, the term
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis> seems to have a neutral connotation, where any negativity
		toward <emphasis>goy</emphasis> would be implied. This may not actually be true, but it
		seems that way. However, it seems during the time of the Prophets and Writings,
			<emphasis>goyim</emphasis> started getting a bad wrap for being primarily idol
		worshippers. This connotation carried over into the <emphasis>Torah sheba'alpeh</emphasis>,
		where <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> as idolaters were solidified. It is only with other
		qualifiers that <emphasis>goy</emphasis> changes its idolater status. This is explained in
			<emphasis>Encyclopedia Talmudit</emphasis> under the <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
		reference.</para>
	<para>The implications of using the vulgar definition of <emphasis>goy</emphasis> are critical
		and highly negative. It's the cause of baseless hatred between Jew and non-Jew alike. It's
		imperative to the redemption that we should be constantly refining and purifying our speech.<footnote>

	<para>There also is a difference between the usage of <emphasis>goy</emphasis> versus
			<emphasis>goyim</emphasis>. This is explained in <emphasis>Encyclopedia
			Talmudit</emphasis> under the <emphasis>goy</emphasis> reference.</para>

		<title>Degradation and Repentance of The Families of the World</title><para>The <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> often denotes groups of people as trees and individuals as
			roots or branches within the tree. These families were all descendents of Noah and were
			referred to as <emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis>: the children of Noah. In these families
			also were people that became the nations: the <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>.
				<emphasis>Bereishit</emphasis> 10:32<footnote>
				<para>"These are the families of the bnei Noach(sons of Noah), after their
					generations, in their goyim(nations): and by these were the goyim(nations)
					divided in the earth after the flood." - Bereishit 10:32</para>
			</footnote> shows a time when all <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>, <emphasis>bnei
				Noach</emphasis>, and the families of the world were most likely at their purest in
			being <emphasis>mitzuveh v'oseh</emphasis>/commanded and does, in the seven commandments
			of <emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis>. Over time, we will show that
				<emphasis>goyim</emphasis> not only fell away from doing the seven as <emphasis>bnei
				Noach</emphasis>, but how the term <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> started to refer not
			to a nation, but to an idolatrous non-Jew who was not diligent in the seven.
				<emphasis>Bnei Noach</emphasis> were commanded in the seven commandments of the
			children of Noah and did these seven commandments. The <emphasis>ikkar</emphasis> term
			for this is <emphasis>mitzuveh v'oseh</emphasis>: commanded and does(as opposed to
				<emphasis>lo'mitzuveh v'oseh</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>
			commanded and does). Strong individuals were seen as roots of a tree and their offspring
			as the offshoots of that root. These individuals were the fathers of their respective
			families that formed the nations of the world: the <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>. All early
				<emphasis>Bnei Noach</emphasis>, and their respective
			<emphasis>goy</emphasis>/nation, kept the seven commandments of <emphasis>Bnei
				Noach</emphasis>. However, over time, <emphasis>Bnei Noach</emphasis> started to
			transgress the seven commandments of the <emphasis>Bnei Noach</emphasis>.<footnote>
				<para>Bava Kamma 38</para>
			</footnote>It is here described in <emphasis>Bava Kamma</emphasis> 38 and in
				<emphasis>Yad, Hilchot Avodah Zarah</emphasis> 1:1 where <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>
			begin to backslide from the seven and <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>(often wrote as just
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis> at this point) becomes it's own <emphasis>ikkar</emphasis>
			term to mean <emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis> that <emphasis role="bold">don't</emphasis>
			keep the seven and are destructive in the world, while the <emphasis>ikkar</emphasis>
			term <emphasis>bnei Noach</emphasis> is used to denote people who <emphasis role="bold"
				>do</emphasis> keep the seven and make the world hospitable. Instead of being viewed
			in a positive light, <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> started to backslide into
				<emphasis>avodah zarah</emphasis>/idolatry(lit. strange worship) and were from then
			on assumed that their intentions were for <emphasis>avodah zarah</emphasis> and not for
			the worship of <emphasis>haShem</emphasis> unless explicitly stated otherwise.<footnote>

			referring to non-Jews that keep the seven. Otherwise, the term <emphasis>goy</emphasis>
			is used, which implies a person that is not careful in the seven. This is clearly
			defined and expressed in Rabbinic writings from the Talmud on, which started to use the
			term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> disparagingly rather than the term <emphasis>bnei
				Noach</emphasis> to denote someone who does the seven commandments of the
				<emphasis>Bnei Noach</emphasis>.<footnote>

				<para>Encyclopedia Talmudit, Volume 5, definition of <emphasis>goy</emphasis></para>

				<emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>. A <emphasis>min</emphasis> is a <emphasis>ben
				Yisrael</emphasis>, but he is a heretic, so a new term is created for such a
				<emphasis>ben Yisrael</emphasis>: a <emphasis>min</emphasis>. From this,
				<emphasis>Avraham</emphasis> emerged and started to get the tree of humanity back on
			the right track. Through <emphasis>Avraham</emphasis>, all of the families of the world
			are blessed. There was an age in history where this tree of civilization was still being

				<emphasis>Avraham</emphasis> is the father of <emphasis>goyim</emphasis>. The
				<emphasis>Aleinu</emphasis> prayer states that the <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> of the
			land and the families of the world bow down to vanity a nothingness. Eventually, the
				<emphasis>goyim</emphasis> will be brought low and <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> will
			be brought high. The <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> will come to
				<emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> and attach to <emphasis>Yisrael</emphasis> and start

		<para>The words <emphasis>goy</emphasis> and <emphasis>am</emphasis> are usually both
			translated as "people" or "nation" and are seemingly interchangeable. However, that
			doesn't seem to be the case every time. <emphasis>Goy</emphasis> seems to denote
			something akin to culture and way of life and a common king. <emphasis>Am</emphasis>
			seems to denote physical groups of people that live and interact with one another, but
			do not have a common king. <emphasis>Bnei Yisrael</emphasis> is referred to as a holy
				<emphasis>goy</emphasis>; often translated as <emphasis>holy nation</emphasis>. -

				<para>Some say that this citation is referring to only the context of wine. It's true that this

					drinking from wine, which can be permitted or forbidden, and/or from benefiting
					from wine, whether permitted or forbidden. Rambam often writes in incomplete
					sentences, much like an outline, so Rambam is trying to clarify here. Also, the

				<para> Meiri, Bet Habechirah, Avodah Zarah, 53 It has already been stated that these
					things [laws relating to gentiles] were said concerning periods when there
					existed nations of idolaters, and they were contaminated in their deeds and
					tainted in their dispositions . . . but other nations, which are restrained by
					the ways of religion and which are free from such blemishes of character – on
					the contrary, they even punish such deeds – are, without doubt, exempt from this
					prohibition. ]לח[ מאירי, בית הבחירה ע"ז כב, א וכבר התבאר שדברים הללו נאמרו לאותם

				<para>[39] Be’er haGolah to Choshen Mishpat 425:5. The rabbis of the Talmud meant by
					the term ‘idolaters’ the pagans who lived in their time, who worshipped the
					stars and the constellations and did not believe in the Exodus from Egypt and in
					the creation of the world out of nothing. But the nations under whose benevolent
					shadow we, the Jewish nation, are exiled and are dispersed among them, they do
					believe in the creation of the world out of nothing and the Exodus from Egypt
					and in the essentials of faith, and their whole intention is toward the Maker of
					heaven and earth, as other authorities have said . . . these nations do believe
					in all of this. ]לט[ באר הגולה, חושן משפט תכה:ה לא אמרו חז"ל דבר זה אלא על

			</footnote>Other peoples are definitely <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> as well, but have
			qualifiers. Bnei Yisrael is a good example; they are referred to as <emphasis>goy
				kadosh</emphasis>. Kadosh is the qualifier and thus this is not referring to the
			idol-worshipper. This is a common confusion point where many people will say that "goy"
			is just a general term. Rambam is explicitly taking the generality out of the equation
			to let the reader know he is explicitly referring to an idolater. Talmud Bavli, Gittin
			45b, Rabbi Eliezer says an unspecified <emphasis>goy</emphasis> is treated like an

		<para>There are two main types of <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> study:

				<emphasis>Osek</emphasis> is when you completely lose yourself in the study and
			digest what you're learning on a very deep level. In <emphasis>osek</emphasis> type of
			study, you are completely involved. You are constantly thinking about a thing, concept,
			idea, verse, etc. A <emphasis>goy</emphasis> cannot <emphasis>osek</emphasis> himself in
			complete <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> study. A <emphasis>goy</emphasis> can only

						Commandments they accepted upon themselves, and permitted their property to

							themselves, so He permitted their property to the Jews," as long as they
							are obliged by these commandments -- therefore, those [non-Jews] who
