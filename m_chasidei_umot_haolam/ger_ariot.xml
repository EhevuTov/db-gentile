	<title>Sojourners of Lions</title>
	<subtitle>גרי - Gerei Ari'ot</subtitle>
	<para><emphasis>Gerei Ari'ot</emphasis> are sojourners of lions. This is a term for sojourners who
		were so fearful of the wildlife in the area, they took upon the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>,
		thinking the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> would protect them. They had no intention of keeping
		the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> for its own sake, for the sake of Heaven, or the like.<footnote><para>II Kings I believe. The kuthim/Samaritans</para></footnote></para>
	<para>The term <emphasis>goy</emphasis> seems to have a neutral connotation, where any
		negativity toward <emphasis>goy</emphasis> would be implied. However, it seems during the
		time of the Prophets and Writings, <emphasis>goyim</emphasis> started getting a bad wrap for
		being idol worshippers.</para>
