		<title>Preface</title>
		<para>This is much of my life's work regarding regarding the non-Jew in <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>
			from my own personal study. I'm not a Rabbi. I'm a non-Jew who studies
				<emphasis>Torah</emphasis> and listens to Rabbis. I would like to share with
			everyone what I've found. These answers were received from my questioning
				<emphasis>Torah</emphasis>. I think many of us ask that question yet many of us get
			bogged down and never find definative answers, which demoralize many of us to the point
			of giving up or disbelief. I like to think this book will convey the things I found that
			I believe are incumbant on every human-being to know and it would be a personal tragedy
			if I did not convey it for posterity.</para>
		<para>I will use Hebrew words and phrases to help convey the original wisdom in context. Any
			translations into English are my own. Transliterated words will be italicised. I try to
			use only <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> sources, but when I deviate, it will most likely be
			due to problems in English words and their understanding that I need to rectify.
			Translated words from their original Hebrew often come out as vulgar. I do my best to
			not be common in my language. There is a balance that must be met between stooping
			language down for the simple man to understand and between giving the unadulterated
			wisdom. I think that balance is to use transliterated Hebrew nouns at the very least. If
			you're reading this book, then that means you must have the aptitude to learn new ideas
			and new words. We might as well learn the actual Hebrew word in context, rather than a
			translation that usually bastardizes the original meaning and wisdom of the word.</para>
		<para>For most of the book, I'll be using the term <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> which is the
			Hebrew translation for <emphasis>children of Israel</emphasis>. It's common today to
			refer to <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> as "Jews" or the Jewish People, but for the
			sake of clarity, I'll be using <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> instead, which is
			usually the phrase used in <emphasis>Torah</emphasis>.</para>
		<para>If I give my opinion about a matter, I usually preface the statement with "It appears
			to me" or "In my opinion". I also ask questions that I would like to know answers to.
			Please contact me by posting your succinct input in our Google Group "Bnei
			Noach".</para>
		<para>This book is organic and living. Instead of having a number of editions, I will be using a
			version number, similar to that of computer software and only use numbered editions when
			printing. The source files for the book are housed in a version controlled repository
			that is constantly being added to, updated, fixed and processed into multiple media
			formats.</para>

		<subtitle>אומות העולם - Umot haOlam</subtitle>
		<partintro>
			<para><emphasis>
				Umot haOlam</emphasis> is translated as "People of the World" and it has a specific definition
				in <emphasis>CHABAD Chassidut</emphasis>. Within the set of <emphasis>Umot
					haOlam</emphasis> are specific subsets. Depending on what the set is referring
				to, these subsets are either subsets entirely, or have some mutual exclusivity, in
				respect to properties. For instance, all humans have chromosomes, but not all humans
				keep kosher; it's in respect to the properties talk about.</para>
			<para>Every human being takes an oath in utero to be righteous(Niddah 30b, Iyov).</para>
			<para>Every human being has 613 bones that desire to do mitzvot.</para>
			<para>Every human being who's spirit moves them, can obtain understanding and with his
				knowledge set himself different and stand before <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>, to
				serve and minister to Him and to know <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>, walking straight
				as <emphasis>Elokim</emphasis> made him, and and can remove the yoke of the thoughts
				of <emphasis>bnei Adam</emphasis>. This human being is sanctified like the
					<emphasis>Kadosh Kadoshim</emphasis>. <emphasis>haShem</emphasis> is his portion
				and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like
				He provides for priests and Levites. Thus David, peace be upon him, said<footnote>
					<para>Tehillim 16:5</para>
				</footnote> "<emphasis>haShem</emphasis> is my lot and my portion; You are my cup;
				you support my lot."<footnote>
					<para>Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Shemita v'Yovel 13:13</para>
