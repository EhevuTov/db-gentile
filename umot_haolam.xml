    <partintro>
        <para>We first need to talk about souls and where they emanate from.
                <emphasis>Klipah</emphasis> is the Hebrew word for shell; a shell or rind of a
            fruit, for instance. Just as <emphasis>klipah</emphasis> blocks one from getting to the
            good fruit inside, so too, <emphasis>klipah</emphasis> blocks Godliness from being seen
            in this world. There are four major kinds of <emphasis>klipah</emphasis>. There are
            three completely impure and opaque <emphasis>klipot</emphasis> called <emphasis>klipat
                tameyut</emphasis> that does not allow any Godliness to shine through it. There is a
            fourth <emphasis>klipah</emphasis> which is a mixture of pure and impure called
                <emphasis>klipat nogah</emphasis>, which is an illuminating shell.<footnote>
                <para>Tanya, Ch. 1</para>
            </footnote> It is not opaque, but translucent and allows Godliness to shine through
            it.</para>
        <para>Every living thing with blood in its body has an animal soul called a <emphasis>nefesh
                behemut</emphasis> and a Godly soul called a <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis>. The
                <emphasis>nefesh behamut</emphasis> emanates from the <emphasis>klipot</emphasis>.
            The <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis> is truly a part of <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>.
            Everyone can detect their <emphasis>nefesh behemut</emphasis>, but not everyone can
            detect or is ruled by their <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis>. All <emphasis>nefeshot
                behemut</emphasis> emanate from some type of <emphasis>klipah</emphasis> depending
            on what type of <emphasis>nefesh behemut</emphasis> it has. Unlike the <emphasis>nefesh
                behemut</emphasis> that emanates from <emphasis>klipah</emphasis>, the
                <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis> emanates completely, and is directly a part of,
                <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>While there is only one <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis>, there are two major kinds
            of <emphasis>nefashot behemot</emphasis>. <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> have
                <emphasis>nefashot behemot</emphasis> that emanate from the three, completely
            impure, <emphasis>klipot tameyut</emphasis>. Because <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis>
            emanate from the completely impure <emphasis>klipat tameyut</emphasis>, people that have
            these animal souls do not detect Godliness on their own and therefore are seemingly
            completely removed from their <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis>/Godly soul.</para>
        <para>All human beings have a Godly soul called a <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis>. The
                <emphasis>nefesh Elokit</emphasis> is completely concealed in the <emphasis>Umot
                haOlam</emphasis>. It hovers over them and is distant from them as what is called
                <emphasis>makif rachok</emphasis>.<footnote>
                <para>Ginsburgh, Kabbalah and Meditation for the Nations, page 55-56</para>
            </footnote></para>
        <para>Now that we have a little bit of information on the substance of souls, we can now
            talk about a certain type of soul that the <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> have.
                <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> is translated as "The People of the World".
                <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> is the technical term for anyone who is not
                <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis> and are connected only to this world and do not
            have a portion in The World to Come. <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> are different in
            contrast to <emphasis>Chasidei Umot haOlam</emphasis>. <emphasis>Chasidei Umot
                haOlam</emphasis> are not of <emphasis>bnei Yisrael</emphasis>, but are connected to
            The World to Come. Both <emphasis>Chasidei Umot haOlam</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bnei
                Yisrael</emphasis> have <emphasis>nefashot behemot</emphasis>/animal souls that
            emanate from the same place: <emphasis>klipat nogah</emphasis>, which is a mixture of
            pure and impure and such a <emphasis>nefesh</emphasis> can be elevated; this is where
            all clean animals emanate from. A <emphasis>nefesh</emphasis> from the <emphasis>klipat
                tameyut</emphasis> cannot yet be elevated; this is where all unclean animals emanate
            from and this is the soul type of <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>Every human being takes an oath in utero to be righteous.<footnote>
                <para>Niddah 30b, Iyov</para>
            </footnote> The <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> have forsaken this oath. All human
            beings have 613 parts of the body.<footnote>

                <para>Likutei Torah, Eikev 13b; 14a</para>
            </footnote> These 613 parts correlate to the 613 <emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis> written in
            the <emphasis>Torah</emphasis> and each have a respective conduit that connect to
                <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>. We you fulfill a <emphasis>mitzvah</emphasis> you
            complete this conduit and Godliness flows into the world.<footnote>

            </footnote></para>
        <para>Of those 613 parts, 248 are bones that desire to do <emphasis>mitzvot</emphasis>. All
            men are called to love <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>.<footnote>

        <para>The <emphasis>Umot haOlam</emphasis> forsake the desire to love
                <emphasis>haShem</emphasis> and are motivated only for self-serving motives.</para>
        <sidebar><para>R"AMBAM writes: Every human being who's spirit moves them, can obtain understanding, and with
                his knowledge, set himself different and stand before <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>,
                to serve and minister to Him and to know <emphasis>haShem</emphasis>, walking
                straight as <emphasis>Elokim</emphasis> made him, and can remove the yoke of the
                thoughts of <emphasis>bnei Adam</emphasis>. This human being is sanctified like the
                    <emphasis>Kadosh Kadoshim</emphasis>. <emphasis>haShem</emphasis> is his portion
                and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like
                He provides for priests and Levites. Thus David, peace be upon him, said
                    "<emphasis>haShem</emphasis> is my lot and my portion; You are my cup; you
                support my lot."<footnote>
